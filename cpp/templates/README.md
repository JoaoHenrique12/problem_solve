# Templates

In C++, both `<class T>` and `<typename T>` are used to define template parameters.
They essentially serve the same purpose, and there's no functional difference between them.
However, there are some subtle differences in usage and historical context:

1. **`<class T>`**: Historically, the keyword `class` was used to declare template parameters in C++.
This is because, when C++ templates were first introduced, they were primarily used for defining template
classes (i.e., classes that are parameterized by one or more types).
Over time, the usage of `class` in this context became a convention, even though it's not strictly accurate
from a language grammar perspective. This convention persists in much of the existing C++ codebase.

2. **`<typename T>`**: The keyword `typename` is a more accurate and modern keyword to use when 
declaring template parameters that represent types.
It explicitly states that `T` is a type and can be any type, not necessarily a class.
This can be more appropriate when writing generic code that may operate on non-class types,
such as built-in types or type aliases.

In practice, both `<class T>` and `<typename T>` are widely used and accepted in modern C++ code.
Many programmers and coding style guides prefer `<typename T>` for its clarity and accuracy, especially in
generic code where the template parameter might not necessarily represent a class.
However, you will often see `<class T>` in existing codebases due to historical reasons and convention.
Ultimately, the choice between them comes down to personal preference or adherence to a particular coding style guide.
